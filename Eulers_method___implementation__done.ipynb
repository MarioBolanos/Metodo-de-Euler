        "In all kinds of natural sciences, we encounter differential equations. These equations can be quite complicated to solve analytically, and most times there does not exist an analytical solution. Nonetheless, we still need solve these kinds of equations in order for them to better our understanding of whichever underlying physical system we are working with.\n",

        "For many students, understanding how to solve ordinary differential equations, ODEs for short, can be a time consuming and frustrating process. The purpose of this notebook is to simply demonstrate __how__ an ODE can be solved. Will not focus on the theory behind Euler's method, we will solely focus on the __implementation__ of our ODE solver. Ideally, the reader should also understand the theory and possible pitfalls of using Euler's method, thus we strongly recommend also reading our other module on *[Euler's method](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.numfys.net/media/notebooks/eulers_method.ipynb)* (Note: This module will be updated shortly after the publication of this notebook). \n",

        "If you are more interested how one can validate numerical results through physical arguments, we have already written two other notebooks that use similar arguments. Namely, simulating a *[charge particle in a uniform magnetic field](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.numfys.net/media/notebooks/uniform_magnetic_field_final.ipynb)* , and *[a simple pendulum](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.numfys.net/media/notebooks/simple_pendulum.ipynb)*. In physics, energy conservation is frequently used as such an argument.\n",

        "Even though Euler's method is very simple to implement, it is still a powerful tool for solving ODEs. In this notebook we have used Euler's method to solve the differential equation governing population growth in a bacterial colony, but the implementation can also be used to solve any ODE with no explicit time dependence. However, as we already have alluded to, the reader should be familiar with the various pitfalls and limitations of Euler's method. Check out our more thorough and complete notebook on *[Euler's method](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.numfys.net/media/notebooks/eulers_method.ipynb)* if you are curious to learn more!"
