        "Solving differential equation is at the heart of both physics and mathematics. Ordinary differential equations, ODEs for short, appear in all kinds of problems in physics, whether it being Newtonian mechanics (where we try to find the equations of motion), electromagnetic theory, or quantum mechanics. However, more often than not, these ODEs do not have analytical solutions, and we have to solve them numerically. In this notebook we will give an extensive review of Euler's method, the simplest algorithm for solving ODEs. In contrast with our other notebook on Euler's method, *[ Simple implementation of Euler's method](https://github.com/MarioBolanos/Metodo-de-Euler/blob/master/Eulers_method___implementation__done.ipynb)*, we will cover the algorithm quite thoroughly as we will show the derivation of the method, error estimates, and stability. Lastly, we will show how we can use Euler's method to solve higher order differential equations, by reducing them to a system of first order differential equations. \n",

If we have the initial condition $y(0) = y_0$, how do we solve $(1)$? Analytically there exists a multitude of different schemes to solve these kinds of equations, all with their own limitations and areas of use. An example of this is the *[Integrating factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrating_factor)*, which is a scheme that the reader might already be familiar with. However, all these analytical schemes depend on the __existence__ of an analytical solution. By solving equation $(1)$ numerically we are not restricted to these kinds of ODEs, and thus we have opened a Pandora's box of new ODEs that we can solve!"

You might think of $h$ as the coarseness of our time variable; the smaller $h$, the more grid points we need to cover the same time interval. For instance, if we want to discretize the interval $[0,1]$ such that we have grid points every 0.01 seconds, i.e. the distance between grid points is 0.01 (recall that this is our definition of $h$), we use equation $(2)$, to deduce that we need $N=100$. In general, our numerical approximation will be better if we choose a small $h$. Note as the size of $h$ decreases, the number of discrete time values between $t_0$ and $t_N$ increases. We pay for the increased level of precision by increasing the number of calculations needed, thus increasing the runtime of our program. It is highly encouraged to reflect over what the necessary coarseness of our discretized time variable before solving a problem."

        "Analogous to the local truncation error, we have the __global__ truncation error. At each time step of our numerical simulation, we will have an approximation of $y(t)$ at $t=t_n$, denoted $y_{approx}(t_n)$. The global truncation error, $e_n$. is defined as\n",

Note that the global truncation error is not the sum of all the local truncation errors, but rather the accumulation of errors made in each step (i.e. the sum of the local truncation errors __if__ they were defined without the absolute value). Here we present a somewhat heuristic approach to find $e_n$. If we know our local truncation error is of the order $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$, we know that for each time step we get the error $ah^2$, where $a$ is just some constant. In order to get to $t_N$, we need to make $N$ steps, and using equation $(2)$ we see that the number of steps needed is inversely proportional to $h$. Thus the accumulated error $e_N = ah^2 \\frac{1}{h} = a h$. Hence, our conclusion is that the global truncation error for the Euler's method is of the order $\\mathcal{O}(h)$. Note that this relation holds in general. If a ODE scheme has local truncation error $\\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$, the global truncation error is $\\mathcal{O}(h^{p})$.\n",

        "We can deem the results produced by Euler's method as valid due to our physical understanding of the problem. On the plot to the right we we can study the speed of the metal sphere as it falls towards the earth. The concept of terminal speed. i.e. when the drag force is equal to the gravitational force, is useful here. We observe that after the initial acceleration, the speed seems to flatten out at around 60 m/s. However, we know that the speed of the sphere should in fact increase even more, as the gravitational pull of the earth will pull stronger as the sphere is towards the center of the earth (remember, gravity scales as $\\frac{1}{r^2}$). Let's see if we can observe this effect in our numerical solution."

        "Euler's method is a simple numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations, and it's simplicity manifests itself both in the straightforward numerical implementation, but also in the power of the method to solve more complex problems. For more sophisticated problems that are more prone to numerical errors, more powerful methods such as the forth order Runge-Kutta method should be considered instead (This is done in the aforementioned notebook). However, for the simple examples we considered here, it was sufficient!"
