This notebook gives a more thorough walkthrough of the theoretical aspects of Euler's method as well as providing a slightly more advanced code than our other notebook on Euler's method, which focuses on the *[ implementation of Euler's method](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.numfys.net/media/notebooks/Eulers_method_-_implementation-_done.ipynb)*. We will illustrate how one can use this simple numerical method to solve higher order differential equations, as well as explaining the notions of instability and local and global truncation errors.
